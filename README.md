# HRNET, the employee management application of the company Wealth Health

This project was coded entirely using React and Tailwind Css. It is the new version of [the previous application](https://github.com/almoha73/P14_Front-end) coded using JQuerry.\
You will see a total redesign of the style, as well as the management of employee storage which is now done in a database managed by Firebase.

## THE LOGIN PAGE

Only administrators can log in.
For the test of this version the login: `hrnetadmin@test.fr` password: `azerty`

## DEPENDENCIES USED

To change the JQuerry plugins and React components I used :
- react-datepicker for both date inputs
- antd for the array
- @headlessui/react and @heroicons/react/20/solid for the inputs with options
-  a custom modal whose code source you can find [here](https://github.com/almoha73/modal-agnes-p14) and the package on npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/modalagnes73).





## To launch the application
### `npm start`
